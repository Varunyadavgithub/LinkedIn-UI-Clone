# 📌LinkedIn UI Clone

## Description📑
Welcome to my project which is a UI clone of the LinkedIn platform. I created this project to practice and improve my knowledge 
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By making a copy of the LinkedIn website's look and feel, I'm getting hands-on experience with 
building web pages and making them interactive. It's like a fun exercise to sharpen my web development skills and learn more 
about how websites work.
